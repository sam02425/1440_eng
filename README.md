## Multi-View Deep Learning for Retail Object Detection: A Comprehensive Framework and Empirical Analysis

**Abstract:**

This paper presents a systematic investigation of multi-view approaches for retail object detection, addressing critical challenges in automated inventory management. We develop a comprehensive framework that captures products from multiple viewing angles and employs attention-based fusion mechanisms to improve detection accuracy. Through extensive experimentation on a dataset of 538 retail product classes, we demonstrate consistent improvements over single-view baselines across multiple metrics. Our approach achieves statistically significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) with reductions in false positive rates and enhanced robustness to occlusion. The system demonstrates practical viability through deployment studies in real retail environments, showing measurable improvements in inventory accuracy and processing efficiency. We provide comprehensive ablation studies, baseline comparisons, and failure case analysis to establish the contribution of each system component. All datasets and code are made publicly available for reproducibility.
