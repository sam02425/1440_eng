## Abstract

The retail industry faces critical challenges in automated product recognition and inventory management, with traditional single-view approaches struggling to maintain accuracy in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents a comprehensive solution combining 360-degree product imaging with advanced deep learning architectures. Our novel multi-view fusion algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple retail environments, demonstrating significant improvements in challenging scenarios such as occluded products and non-standard orientations. Through extensive experimentation on a large-scale dataset of 538 product classes and real-world deployment studies, we validate the system's effectiveness and provide practical implementation guidelines for retail environments. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of our improvements (p < 0.001) across all key metrics. Datasets are publicly available at https://universe.roboflow.com/lamar-university-venef/liquor-data and https://universe.roboflow.com/lamar-university-venef/grocery-rfn8l for reproducibility.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The retail industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, as comprehensively documented by Patel's (2024) landmark dissertation on computer vision in retail stores. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $31.5 billion by 2028, driven by advanced technological solutions. Wei et al.'s (2019) landmark RPC dataset underscores the critical need for sophisticated object detection systems that can address persistent challenges such as:

- Annual inventory shrinkage exceeding $100 billion globally (NRF, 2024)
- Average stockout rates of 8.3% leading to $984 billion in lost sales (IHL Group, 2023)
- Manual inventory count accuracy averaging only 63% (Deloitte Retail Analysis, 2024)
- Growing demand for real-time inventory tracking and automated checkout systems

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current retail object detection systems face several critical limitations spanning both technical and operational domains. From a technical perspective, systems struggle with limited visibility in dense product arrangements and face significant difficulties in distinguishing between visually similar products. Performance degradation occurs when products are occluded or misoriented, and inconsistent lighting conditions further complicate detection accuracy. Operational challenges include maintaining real-time processing capabilities while scaling to accommodate large product catalogs. Integration complexity and cost constraints pose additional barriers to widespread adoption.

### 2.2 Retail-Specific Challenges

The retail environment presents unique challenges extensively documented in recent literature. Goldman et al.

The proposed system architecture integrates multiple technological components to create a comprehensive multi-view product detection framework:

#### 3.1.1 Multi-View Geometry Integration

Our approach extends traditional multi-view geometry with novel deep learning components. Let X = {x₁, ..., xₙ} represent n views of an object, where each xᵢ ∈ ℝ^(H×W×C). The multi-view fusion function F is defined as:

F(X) = σ(∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ wᵢφ(xᵢ))

where:
- φ(·): Feature extraction function
- wᵢ: Learned view importance weights  
- σ: Nonlinear activation function

#### 3.1.2 Data Processing Pipeline

The system's processing pipeline integrates multiple stages:

1. **High-resolution image acquisition**: Capturing detailed product features through state-of-the-art imaging equipment
2. **Multi-angle feature extraction**: Processing visual information from multiple viewpoints
3. **Attention-based view fusion**: Intelligently combining information from different angles
4. **Real-time detection and classification**: Enabling immediate product recognition

### 3.2 Dataset Construction

#### 3.2.1 Data Collection Strategy

Our dataset development employed a sophisticated automated scanning system within operational retail environments. The system captured 360-degree product images using high-resolution cameras, collecting 72 images at precise 5-degree intervals for each product. This resulted in:

- **Total classes**: 538 distinct product classes
- **Liquor categories**: 404 classes

Systematic data augmentation techniques were implemented:
- Random rotations: [-15°, +15°] range
- Color jittering: [0.8, 1.2] parameters
- Random occlusion: 0% to 30%
- Lighting variations: [0.7, 1.3] range

### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics

#### 3.4.1 Primary Metrics

**Mean Average Precision (mAP):**
mAP = (1/|C|) ∑_{c∈C} AP_c

where AP_c represents the average precision for class c.

**View Fusion Quality (VFQ):**
VFQ = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ αᵢ * IoU(pᵢ, g)

where pᵢ denotes the prediction from view i, g represents the ground truth, and αᵢ indicates the view importance weight.
